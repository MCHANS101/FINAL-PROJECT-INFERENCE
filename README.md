# FINAL-PROJECT-INFERENCE
This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of classical optimization techniques for parameter estimation in both linear and logistic regression models using simulated data in R.

Key components:Simulated Normal and Binomial Data for linear and logistic models.
	•	Estimation Techniques:Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Newton-Raphson Method, Fisher Scoring Algorithm,Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm
 	•	Comparative Analysis of the algorithms based on: Accuracy (Mean Squared Error),Convergence performance,Computational time,	Robustness to initialization

 Purpose:

To evaluate the efficiency and robustness of different inference techniques in estimating model parameters under various statistical conditions.

  Tools:
	•	Language: R
	•	Libraries: stats, base
